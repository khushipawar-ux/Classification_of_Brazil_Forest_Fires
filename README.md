# Classification of Brazil Forest Fires

## Project Overview
This project analyzes forest fire data in Brazil to understand trends, patterns, and potential classification of fire incidents based on time and location. By leveraging Python's data analysis and visualization libraries, it aims to gain insights from historical fire records.

## Dataset
The dataset used is `brazil.csv`, which contains the following key columns:
- **year**: Year of the recorded fire.
- **state**: Brazilian state where the fire occurred.
- **month**: Month of occurrence (in Portuguese).
- **number**: Number of fire occurrences.
- **date**: Full date of the incident.

The dataset comprises 6,454 rows.

## Features and Functionality
- **Data Cleaning and Loading**: Initial steps for reading the CSV file and preparing the data.
- **Visualization**: Fire trends visualized using `matplotlib`.
- **Translation**: Translation capabilities using `googletrans` to handle non-English text.
- **Classification**: A planned (or existing) classification model to categorize fires based on input features.

## Installation
To run the notebook, install the required dependencies:
pip install pandas matplotlib googletrans==4.0.0-rc1 httpx==0.13.3

Ensure that your Python environment can handle these packages.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project folder.
2. Install dependencies as shown above.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the cells in sequence to analyze the data.

## Results
The notebook produces several visualizations and may include classification outputs based on the fire records.

Does this structure align with what you're envisioning for your README? Let me know if there are additional details or sections you'd like to add (like machine learning models or specific outputs)!
